This repository is originally from https://github.com/hbenbel/French-Dictionary.git

All work is his. I only uploaded this here for my personal use in my projects and as a quick access backup. Feel free to use. My use case for this is for practicing with a large set of data, for things like sorting algorithms in Python and C++. I am not sure if this can be used in production projects, because definitions and words are being updated periodically. Hence, using APIs from dictionary sites might be recommended.

DESCRIPTION
	CSV files containing all french adjectives, adverbs, conjunctions,
	determiners, nouns, prepositions, pronouns, verbs and their gender,
	types and conjugations. This can be helpful for creating a spell
	and/or a grammar checker for french.
	The files are generated using kaikko's french machine-readable dictionary
	extracted directly from wiktionary (kaikki.org/dictionary/French/index.html).
	You can find all the words in the csv files inside the dictionary folder.
	Those files can be directly loaded using pandas.

USAGE
	If you want to regenerate the dictionary files first make sure that you
	have all the required packages in the requirements.txt file.
	Then you can launch the following command:

	python src/extract_data_from_json.py [-h]
			--json_file_path JSON_FILE_PATH --saving_path SAVING_PATH

	required arguments:
		--json_file_path JSON_FILE_PATH, -i JSON_FILE_PATH
						Path to the wiktionary json file

		--saving_path SAVING_PATH, -s SAVING_PATH
						Path to the folder that will contain the
						output csv files
